# Question 1 – Student Marks Array

**Problem:**
The marks obtained by five students are `[78, 65, 89, 56, 92]`. Create a NumPy array and display the array along with its basic properties.

```python
import numpy as np

marks = np.array([78, 65, 89, 56, 92])

print("Question 1 - Student Marks Array")
print("Marks:", marks)
print("Number of dimensions:", marks.ndim)
print("Shape:", marks.shape)
print("Size:", marks.size)
print("Data type:", marks.dtype)
```

### Output

```text

Marks: [78 65 89 56 92]
Number of dimensions: 1
Shape: (5,)
Size: 5
Data type: int64
```

marks = np.array([72, 85, 64, 90, 76])

print("Question 2 - Student Marks Access")
print("Marks:", marks)

print("First student mark:", marks[0])
print("Third student mark:", marks[2])
print("Last student mark:", marks[-1])

print("First three students:", marks[:3])
